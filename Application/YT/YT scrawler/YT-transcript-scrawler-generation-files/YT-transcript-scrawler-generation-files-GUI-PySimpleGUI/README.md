# README
Please read me before running the code.

We have to do some preparation before running the code.

## Preparation
Since this code will execute other.py file with DOS cmd.

1. Make sure that you can execute .py file in DOS cmd. Type
    
       python <.py>
  
For newer version. Type

       python3 <.py>
  
where 
        
        <.py> indicates the .py file name, it can be either an absolute path or relative path.

2. Download the latest release code of YT-transcript-scrawler-generation-files-cmd-code-vn.py and test it with DOS cmd to check the code is correct.

At present, the latest version is v3 (i.e.YT-transcript-scrawler-generation-files-cmd-code-v3.py) 

3. I recommend yon to copy and paste input to DOS cmd into a notepad. 

The reason is you can easily copy and paste it into input field of GUI window and it avoid spelling wrong while you type in input fields.

4. Some Python modules (such as PySimpleGUI ) are installed and work properly.

5. ORDER_class.py

Since I use the ORDER class in ORDER_class.py (i.e. I call ORDER_class.ORDER class) and so is YT-transcript-scrawler-generation-files-cmd-code-v3.py

one have to put the ORDER_class.py, YT-transcript-scrawler-generation-files-cmd-code-v3.py and this file in same directory before running this code.
