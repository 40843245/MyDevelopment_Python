# README
Please read me before running the code.
We have to do some preparation before running the code.
## Preparation
Since this code will execute other.py file with DOS cmd.
1. Make sure that you can execute .py file in DOS cmd. Type
    
       python <.py>
  
For newer version. Type

       python3 <.py>
  
where 
        
        <.py> indicates the .py file name, it can be either an absolute path or relative path.

2. Download the latest release code of YT-transcript-scrawler-generation-files-cmd-code-vn.py and test it with DOS cmd to check the code is correct.

At present, the latest version is v3 (i.e.YT-transcript-scrawler-generation-files-cmd-code-v3.py)
